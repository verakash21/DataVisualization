# DataVisualization
This project includes some basic Data Visualization while trying to learn explanatory and exploratory visualization techniques. 
These were created using tools like Processing(https://processing.org/) and Python Plotly(https://plotly.com/python/). 

## Project Details: 

A. Processing(https://processing.org/):
Created using open source tool called Processing (https://processing.org/), developed by MIT graduates and recommended by Professor John.
The tools provide basic functions and parameters to achieve effects shown in above visualization. 
Although, all the features are not used, but using this simple practice its easy to create visualization using few lines of code.

    1. Recreate Minard’s visualization of Napolean’s Russian Campaign 
    Link to Project: (https://github.com/verakash21/DataVisualization/tree/master/minard)
    
    This visualization shows the numerical data on geographic maps of Napoleons army's huge loss recorded by Charles Joseph Minard. This illustrates thick/thin lines as the size of his army at specific geographic points during their arrival and return. It displays 6 types of data in two dimensions: the size of Napoleon's army; the relative distance between each point; temperature; latitude and longitude; Minard's interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers.
    It is drawn by mapping latitude and latitude data over the canvas of processing. Once mapping was achieved, it was an easy job to map points and draw line between them. The thickness is passed using Stroke function which was in proportions with the size of army. At the end, the temperate is shown at various positions. There are also different colors used to show different paths along with arrival and return of army.
